## Difference between a Scripting Language and a Programming Language

If you are into coding for a quite good amount of time then you must have heard of these terms. Whenever we talk about any `loosely typed language` then most of the time we say that it must be a Scripting Language, like JavaScript, Python, etc.

And when we talk about `strictly typed language` then we refer to them as Programming Language, like C, C++, Java, etc.

But being `strictly typed` or `loosely typed` is not the only difference between a scripting language and a programming language.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Another difference between a scripting language and a programming language is that one is **` compiled`** and the other is **`interpreted`**.

In programming languages, like C++, Java, to run a program there is a two-step process.

- **Step One:** compile your code and generate a machine-readable version of it.
- **Step Two:** run that machine-readable version to get your result.

So, we say that these languages are `compiled languages`. We have to compile them first, to get our desired result.

While in the case of scripting languages, like JavaScript, we write our code and then directly see the result on the browser (if you are writing JavaScript on the client-side). So, we do not have to do anything from our side to run the script. Though the browser, in this case, will execute the code line by line and will the result.

That‚Äôs why we say that these languages are `interpreted language`.

### ‚û°Ô∏è And one more difference between them is the **`environment`** in which they run (or get executed). 

Like in a `scripting language`, in the runtime environment the Interpreter runs each line of the program one by one and shows the result based on the interpretation of that particular line. If there is any kind of error then it will show that, and if there is no error then it will show our desired result.

While in the case of `programming languages`, they first get compiled so if there is an error regarding syntax or a compilation error, we get it at this time. And if there is an error regarding the semantic or a runtime error, we get it when we run the machine-readable code.
